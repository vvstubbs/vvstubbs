- 👋 Hi, I’m @vvstubbs Valentine Stubbs, but call me Valentine or Val, what ever works.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Voice personal assistants, python,and php. And well lots of things but I won't tire you with a complete list.
- 🌱 Very interest and currently developing Virtual Assistant, AI, and IoT technologies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mycroft, and precise and wake word training. But I'm thinking of trying some other "back engine"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mycroft AI, and other python projects of interest (Now that I'm mostly retired)
- 📫 How to reach me? Several ways, but I guess valentine.stubbs@icloud.com that one always works.
- Note: I work excusivly with Linux, (both my two big machines run openSUSE Tumbleweed), MacOS / iOS / iPadOS 
        and don't forget Raspberry Pi's. So I guess you get the idea, only UNIX or unix like systems. 
- Adendum: Back in the day, when working, I programmed heavily in Clipper, (a dBase compiler, with many extentions)
           and a lot of C programming, but straight C became tedious and Clipper has fallen by the way side. 
           Hence my interest in python.
