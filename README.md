- 👋 Hi, I’m @vvstubbs Valentine Stubbs, I believe every new tech idea has a place.
- 🌱 First and formost I work in UNIX and unix like operating systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Automation, Cyber Security, Python, Rust and C++. Well lots of things, I won't tire you with a complete list.
- 🌱 Very interest and currently developing AI based systems for the info sec space, but I also dabble in some IoT technologies.
- 🌱 I've been involved Cyber Security for mainy years, several in-depth projects of late. I beleieve thst AI has a place in cyber security.
- 💞️ Working on a AI based System Security Assessment system. running on my own self-host AI engine.
- 📫 How to reach me? Several ways, but I guess valentine.stubbs@icloud.com that one always works.
- Note: On my sersonal systems, I work excusivly with UNIX, Linux, MacOS / iOS / iPadOS 
        and don't forget Raspberry Pi's. So I guess you get the idea: only UNIX or unix like systems. 
- Adendum: Back in the day, when working, I programmed heavily in Clipper, (a dBase compiler, with many extentions)
           and a lot of C programming, but straight C became tedious and Clipper has fallen by the way side. 
           Hence my interest in PYTHON, and even RUST.
