- 👋 Hi, I’m @vvstubbs Valentine Stubbs, but call me Valentine or Val, what ever works.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Voice personal assistants, python,and php. And well lots of things but I won't tire you with a complete list.
- 🌱 Very interest and currently developing Virtual Assistant, AI, and IoT technologies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mycroft, and precise and wake word training. But I'm thinking of trying some other "back engine"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mycroft AI, and other python projects of interest (Now that I'm mostly retired)
- 📫 How to reach me? Several ways, but I guess valentine.stubbs@icloud.com that one always works.
- Note: I work excusivly with Linux, (both my two big machines now run Fedora 40** once was openSUSE Tumbleweed), MacOS / iOS / iPadOS 
        and don't forget Raspberry Pi's. So I guess you get the idea, only UNIX or unix like systems. 
- Adendum: Back in the day, when working, I programmed heavily in Clipper, (a dBase compiler, with many extentions)
           and a lot of C programming, but straight C became tedious and Clipper has fallen by the way side. 
           Hence my interest in PYTHON, and maybe even RUST
           
** quite honestly I got tired of the periodic openSUSE uptadt that would render the machine to a state of found on road dead. 
And finding Certain things in the os distro in different places expected by an RPM based distrobution. so I threw in the towel,
backed everting that had not gotten mangeled by the update, and proceeded to laay down roots in the Fedora way of doing this. 
And thus far it was a very good Thinhgs
