- 👋 Hi, I’m @vvstubbs Valentine Stubbs, but call me Valentine or Val, what ever works.
- 🌱 First and formost I work in UNIX and unix like operating systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Voice personal assistants, python,and php. And well lots of things but I won't tire you with a complete list.
- 🌱 Very interest and currently developing AI based systems, and I dabble in some IoT technologies.
- 🌱 Been involved "Cyber" Security, several in-depth projects of late. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you
- 💞️ Working on a AI based System Security Assessment system. running on my own self-host AI engine.
- 📫 How to reach me? Several ways, but I guess valentine.stubbs@icloud.com that one always works.
- Note: On my sersonal systems, I work excusivly with Linux, MacOS / iOS / iPadOS 
        and don't forget Raspberry Pi's. So I guess you get the idea, again I sat it: only UNIX or unix like systems. 
- Adendum: Back in the day, when working, I programmed heavily in Clipper, (a dBase compiler, with many extentions)
           and a lot of C programming, but straight C became tedious and Clipper has fallen by the way side. 
           Hence my interest in PYTHON, and even RUST.
